# UART SPI Interface

## Description

This project allows to simply debug SPI devices with a common microcontroller (uC) like the Arduino or ESP. It will take UART commands and transform them into SPI Signals.
The big benefit of this is that a person can easily test some devices without the need of building a framework around it.
At a later point we will also provide a PC-UI to easier interface with the "converter".
Another goals is to also allow scripting, so that you can create scripts and send them to the uC to run it.
